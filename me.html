        <p>This course was recommended to me by Ming Chow when I expressed interest in continuing my secuirty education. I also have worked a bit as a contractor with Ridiculous Engineering, and I want to improve my web programming and building abilities. In undergrad, I got my minor in Web Development and Programming, so I know a bit of html, css, js, php, indesign, and photoshop.</p>
